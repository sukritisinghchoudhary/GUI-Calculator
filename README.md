This is my First Project which is about Calculator using Tkinter in Python.
This is contains a simple command-line based calculator built using Python. 
The calculator performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
I have starts with tkinter import to initialize the main window.
Then I have given the basic structure for calculator from root=Tk() to create the calculator structure.
Then I have created the buttons for calculator to show the graph of buttons on the calculator.
Then after I have given the command for result to answer the calculation in the calculator. For that I have used def command 
ex:def show(value):
    global answer
    answer+=value
    Label_result.config(text=answer)

At the end just run the .py for thy final result.
